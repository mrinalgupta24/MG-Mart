# E-commerce-Website

Celebal Technology Internship Assignment Week 7. This project demonstrates an e-commerce website built using React, showcasing products through a dummy API. Users can browse products, select items, and view their selections in a cart page, where they can see the total price and the products they've selected.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's used for handling the UI components and managing the application state.

## Features

- **Product Display**: The website showcases products using the Fake Store API, allowing users to browse through a variety of items.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can select products and add them to a cart. The cart page displays the total price and the list of selected products.
